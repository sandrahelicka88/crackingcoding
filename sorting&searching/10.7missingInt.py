'''Given an input file with four bilion non-negative integers, provide an algorithm to generate an integer that is not contained in the file. Asssume you have 1GB of memory available for this task.'''


# size of the file is 4*(10**9)*4bytes = 16GB
# assuming we are having 32-bit integers:
#memory avalaible: 1 * (10**9)*8 = 8 bilion bits memory
